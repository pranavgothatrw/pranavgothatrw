💻 I am a full stack developer, who has a solid grip on the corn stack - Mongodab, Express, React and Node.J.S.  
🧩 I have done everything from front interface to Backand API, including Discord Bots and full web applications.  
🛠️ Most of my projects are made of scratches, including backand architecture, database models and customized user interface.  
🧼 I like to keep my code clean, readable and effective, and I care about how things work under the hood.  

🚀 I have produced and maintained high robots, handled hosting and purineogen, and have worked with real -time systems.  
🤝 I am comfortable working in a single or any team, and I know how to take a project from thoughts to distribution.

🧰 I work with technologies:  
React, Node.JS, Express, Mongodb, Javascript, Guit, Rest Epison, Discord.JS and more.

📚 Always down to learn something new or to do something useful.
